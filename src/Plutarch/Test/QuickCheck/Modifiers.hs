{- | A helper (opaque) newtype for QuickCheck use with 'CurrencySymbol's. Has a
 type-level tag to indicate whether or not it could potentially contain a
 'CurrencySymbol'. We provide instances of 'Arbitrary', 'CoArbitrary' and
 'Function' around this newtype, intended to act on the 'CurrencySymbol' inside
 it.

 The easiest way to use this newtype is by pattern matching:

 > forAll arbitrary $ \(GenCurrencySymbol @WithAdaSymbol sym) -> ...

 You can also \'re-wrap\' for shrinking:

 > shrink $ GenCurrencySymbol @WithAdaSymbol sym

However, as 'GenCurrencySymbol' instances do not shrink, there's not much point.

{- | This instance occasionally has the ability to produce the ADA symbol (that
 is, the empty 'CurrencySymbol'). However, this is weighted quite heavily in
 favour of the ADA symbol: in theory, assuming every byte is equally probable
 (a safe assumption, since 'CurrencySymbol's are in general hashes), the odds
 of getting the ADA symbol should be

 \[
 frac{1}{2^{8 \cdot 28 = 224} + 1}
 \]

 However, in this case, the odds are actually

 \[
 \frac{1}{2^{62} + 1}
 \]

 This is a limitation of probability distributions as implemented by
 QuickCheck, which uses 'Int' for this purpose. Keep this in mind when using
 this generator: if you're unsure, it's better to \'seed\' the
 'WithoutAdaSymbol' instance to a probability you're happy with using
 'Gen.frequency'.

 This instance does not shrink, as it makes very little sense to.

{- | A helper (opaque) newtype for QuickCheck use with 'Value's. Has two type
 arguments, to indicate, in order, what kind of amounts ADA and non-ADA
 entries are allowed to have.

 The 'Value's wrapped inside this type are phase-1 valid; the only validity we
 can't guarantee is to do with amounts, as these depend on choice of
 modifiers.

 The easiest way to use this newtype is by pattern matching:

 > forAll arbitrary $ \(GenValue @NonNegative @Positive val) -> ...

 In this case, the ADA entry in @val@ would contain a non-negative amount, but
 any other entry would contain a strictly positive one.

 You can also \'re-wrap\' for shrinking:

 > shrink $ GenValue @NonNegative @Positive val

 = Note

 As 'GenValue' relies heavily on 'Coercible' to work, the newtype constructors
 of your modifiers need to be in scope, or you will get strange errors. For
 example, if you want to do

 > GenValue @NonNegative @Positive val <- arbitrary

 you must have both the 'NonNegative' and 'Positive' types, as well as their
 newtype constructors, imported.

{- | This instance ensures phase-1 validity up to amounts. Specifically, the
 following are guaranteed to hold irrespective of \'tag choices\':

 - Entries whose 'CurrencySymbol' and 'TokenName' match are unique.
 - \'Outer\' map entries are sorted by 'CurrencySymbol'.
 - \'Inner\' map entries are sorted by 'TokenName'.
 - An ADA entry always exists: this corresponds to a mapping from the
 'CurrencySymbol' @""@ to the 'TokenName' @""@ and an amount.
 - ADA entries have singleton \'inner maps\'.
 - Non-ADA entries have non-empty \'inner maps\'.

 The kind of amount generated for ADA and non-ADA entries is controlled by the
 two tags: the first determines how the ADA amount will get generated, while
 the second determines how any non-ADA amounts get generated. Thus,
 @GenValue 'NonNegative 'Positive@ will mean the ADA entry has a zero or
 positive amount, but any other entry will be strictly positive.

 In order to ensure all invariants hold, the shrinker for 'GenValue' can only
 perform the following on the underlying 'Value':

 - Remove non-ADA \'outer map\' entries;
 - Remove \'inner map\' entries; and
 - Shrink the amounts associated with an entry according to the tags.

 More specifically, neither 'CurrencySymbol' or 'TokenMap' keys will be
 shrunk.

{- | Represents a change in 'POSIXTime'. The @mod@ argument gives the kind of
 change, represented by a QuickCheck modifier, while the @n@ argument is a
 closed (inclusive) upper bound on the magnitude of the change.

 For example, @'TimeDelta' 'Positive' 100@ represents a change in 'POSIXTime'
 from @1@ to @100@ units, while @'TimeDelta' 'NonPositive' 250@ represents a
 change in 'POSIXTime' from @0@ to @-250@. Modifiers intended to work with
 this type are:

 - 'Positive'
 - 'Negative'
 - 'NonPositive'
 - 'NonNegative'
 - 'NonZero'

 The instances for 'TimeDelta' reflect this decision: while other modifiers
 could potentially be useful, this ensures that we have safe behaviour and
 efficient instances.

 'NonZero' is treated a bit specially in that the magnitude indicated by @n@
 is in both the negative /and/ positive direction. Thus,
 @'TimeDelta' 'NonZero' 50@ spans the union of @[-50, -1]@ and @[1, 50]@.

 Shrinking a 'TimeDelta' will shrink towards zero: more specifically, it will
 reduce the magnitude of the change.

 To control what 'TimeDelta' you get, the easiest method is a type signature:
