{- | Benchmarking with a focus on running on many different input sizes and
 inputs.

 Read on below to find out what function you want to use.

 Definition: The cardinality of a certain input size refers to the number of
 possible inputs at that size, regarding the method of input generation that is
 being used. An input generator does not necessarily generate the whole domain
 of the function being benchmarked, so the cardinality of the input size can be
 different from the cardinality of the subset of the domain with that size.

 When randomly generating inputs for small input sizes, achieving 100% coverage
 is difficult. Imagine having already generated 9999 inputs of 10000 possible inputs.
 The random generator will have a chance of 1/10000 of hitting the last possible
 input with each attempt, requiring a huge number of attempts.

 'benchAllSizesUniform' exists for this reason, it makes use of exhaustive
 generation for small input sizes and switches over to random generation for
 larger input sizes seamlessly. The price you pay for that is having to write
 both generators, bundled up in a 'SUniversalGen'. Ideally also the cardinality
 function, this makes things more efficient but is not required.

 All other @bench..@ functions in this module make use of random generation only.

 If you want to bench small input sizes without having to write an 'SUniversalGen',
 you should use 'benchSizesRandom'.

 'benchSizesRandomCached' caches results to speed up benching non-uniform random
 distributions, but is currently not multi-threaded. Unlikely to be useful in
 its current form.

 'benchAllSizesUniform' and 'benchNonTinySizesUniform' deduplicate the inputs,
 making them only suitable for uniform distributions when randomly generating.

 'benchSizesRandom' does no deduplication and no result caching. It is suitable
 for any distribution.

 Deduplicates the randomly generated inputs, so only suitable for uniform

 TODO: This is single-threaded for now, because of accessing the HashTable.

 Threading this seems to be non-trivial because of the HashTable.
 It needs worker threads and channels, with one thread doing the HT
