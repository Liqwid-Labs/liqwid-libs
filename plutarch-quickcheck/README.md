## What is this?

A helper library to write Plutarch-oriented QuickCheck property tests. 
The interfaces `plutarch-quickcheck` provides are designed to look and feel
like writting regular `QuickCheck` properties. 

## What _exactly_ does this do for me?

`QuickCheck`'s interactions with Plutarch can be non-obvious, and much
of the built-in functionality it provides is not very useful for it.
For example, `Arbitrary` typeclass that provide random values for 
properties cannot be used for defining arbitrary Plutarch values.

`plutarch-quickcheck` defines alternative interfaces like
`PArbitrary`, providing interfaces that feels like using normal
`QuickCheck`. As demonstrated below, one can easily define a property
in Plutarch function and use it directly.

```hs
additionCommutative :: Term s (PInteger :--> PInteger :--> PBool)
additionCommutative = plam $ \x y -> x + y #== y + x

quickCheck $ fromPFun additionCommutative -- Magic!
-- +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
```

The library also provides other utilities such as the generation of 
arbitrary Plutarch functions and defining properties for Plutarch functions 
verified by the equivalent Haskell definition. Currently, only functions with 
a single arguement are supported.

```hs
pfunctionGeneration :: Term s (PFun PInteger PInteger :--> PBool)
pfunctionGeneration = plam $ \(PFn (f :: Term s (PInteger :--> PInteger))) -> ...

reverseProperty :: Property
reverseProperty = haskEquiv' reverse (preverse @PBuiltinList)
```

# How do I use this?

We provide extensive documentation in the public modules for those who are
already comfortable with `tasty-quickcheck` and property testing in general; for
those who are not, or those who prefer to learn from examples, we provide three
executable examples:

* `examples/reverse-tests`, which demonstrates how to define a property 
using a Haskell definition for intended behavior.
* `examples/zip-tests`, which demonstrates how to use `fromPFun` to 
define a Plutarch property. 

Users new to the library can read the examples as code, as well as execute the
tests with `cabal test` to see what they do.

We also have [a Notion
article](https://liqwid.notion.site/Testing-without-tears-0479a3532d5f4f0f89a6a158567d3d80)
describing good practices for use of this library, as well as QuickCheck and
`tasty-quickcheck` in general. We recommend reading this even for experienced
QuickCheck hands, as there are a lot of useful, and less-known, bits of
information there.

To integrate this with your project, use Nix. We work against the `master`
branch of [Plutarch](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch-plutus), so you will have to use it
also. See the [`flake.nix`](./flake.nix) file for more details.
